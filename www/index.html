		<h1>Hi, I'm George Savill</h1>
		<h2>A scientist turned software developer</h2>
		<h4>Based in Leeds, UK</h4>

	</div>

	<h2 class="subtitle">A quick introduction...</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Working in science until 2018, when I completed a four year <a href="https://bbsrc.ukri.org/skills/investing-doctoral-training/dtp/" targe="_blank">doctoral training partnership</a> PhD programme at Rothamsted Research and the University of Reading. My research relied on big data generated from the automated analysis of microscopy images to identify <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/69/12/3117/4961347" target="_blank">a link between environment and the distribution of protein bodies in wheat grain.</a> This provided me with an introduction to computing that I explored further through an industrial placement and part-time employment. In 2018 I graduated and became a full-time software developer at Freemans Grattan Holdings in Bradford, UK.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">And some of my work...</h2>

			<h2>Grain size analysis Android application</h2>
			<br>
			<p>During my PhD I undertook a three month placement with <a href="http://petioleapp.com/" target="_blank">Petiole ltd</a>, working from home to develop an Android application that would allow plant science researchers to analyse a sample of grain or plant seed using their smartphone.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The application was prototyped in C++ before being made into an Android application written in Java. It uses the <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV computer vision library</a> to calibrate the phone's camera, and to count and measure a sample of grain. In addition to an overall count, measurements for the area, length, and width of each individual grain are calculated. Any broken or touching grains are identified and removed from the results, which can then be viewed on screen, or exported as a CSV file for further analysis.</p>

			<h2>Custom-built MS Access databases</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Whilst employed part-time at <a href="https://www.plantimpact.com/" target="_blank">Plant Impact ltd,</a> I built a number of custom databases in Microsoft Access. These databases were used by the whole organisation for the tracking of internal and external orders, the management of product development, and the recording of chemical product formulations. These databases replaced various paper records and sprawling spreadsheets, improving productivity throughout the company.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As a volunteer at the <a href="http://www.trust.org.sh/" target="_blank">St Helena National Trust</a> I consolodated membership records from numerous sources into a single Access database, allowing the organisation to more efficiently manage subscriptions.</p>
